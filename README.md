# RPi Covid-19 Mask Detector using Tensorflow v1.13 Object detection
This is the project I did for training a custom image classifier to detect the presence of a COVID mask as a cool Machine Learning problem to solve.  My goal was to run it on a small device that could operate at a very low cost as an egress point to make sure for examples that doctors and nurses were compliant to protect themselves entering a room that could contain a hazard and masks were required. 

I started running it locally on an older graphics card but getting the libraries set right was a chore
